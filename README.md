When in Rome &lt;3

Hello!

HSS here. I'm currently doing a bunch of crash courses on developerment, norworking and programming. My github is a place for me to dump my current project files. I'm studying Python, C+, JS, and more. I'm also studying for my CCNA. Most of my current knowledge comes from HTML, CSS and Markdown. In my spare time I enjoy earning chicken dinners, learning Swedish and painting.

Thanks for poking around.
